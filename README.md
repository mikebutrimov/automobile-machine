For non DUE* boards (project_am_tests) it depends on this fork of stl library:
http://andybrown.me.uk/2011/01/15/the-standard-template-library-stl-for-avr-with-c-streams/

DO NOT FORGET to put it into your arduino ide hardware/tools/avr/lib/avr/include
or somewhere else.

project_am_due_alpine part however works with standart ETL library, available in arduino ide repo.
